Install all the npm packages and run nodemon index.js
First there will be login page on startup where both admin and all the users registered in database can login using their name and password
If a new user is to be registered then that can only be done by admin so on tapping on register here you will be directed to a special login page for user and on logging in 
you will be directed to a dashboard where there are 2 options check attendance and add a user check attendance doesnt work. To add a user you tap on add a user then you will be directed
to a page where you have to enter username password and an img of yourself that you can either click by tapping on click one you will be directed to a page with camera on for that give the 
permission and then on capture button then there will be download option after that go back a page and upload the file after selecting from wherever it was installed. And then tap on submit.
The user will be registered into the database and then they can login later on. Coming to the users after they login there are also two options for them mark attendance check attendance.
Check attendance doesnt work here as well but mark attendance does well partially (i tried my best :)). After you tap on the mark attendance you will be redirected to a page where camera 
will be on . Click the picture when the lighting and everything is ok as for my camera it wasnt working well oh and after you tap on mark my attendance it will throw an error in broswer 
console for it to work you need to reload once after tapping on mark attendance and then you can see in console it compares your face with every img in the database it might take a few
seconds and in the console it will display if your face matched with anyone in the database person 1 equals matched and unknown means didnt match. The order might not be what was in the database
in some cases. This part is only visible in Browser Console so i am sorry about that and thats all :)
